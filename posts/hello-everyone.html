      <h2>Hello Everyone</h2>
      <h5>Mar 22, 2023</h5>
      <p>Let me welcome you to my first ever webpage!<br>...Almost.</p>
      <p>That's the first one I show to others. I tried some html code years ago and it went like, "wait, html is that simple?? How boring". Well, you could say it's very simple when all you do is a <em>hello world</em> page.</p>
      <p>Now here we are. Since you are on a page that has my signature as its title, I think I should give you some clarifications.</p>
      <p>Basically, I want people to be sure I am the owner of the site, that's it.</p>
      <p>And if my name is not enough to prove who I am, here are some facts about me.</p>
      <p>I speak portuguese, and in the northeast region some people say "desgraça!" a lot. Where am I from?<br>
         I like Linux, so I'm using Fedora right now.<br>
         I like games, the ones installed in my computer are Overwatch 2, Mount & Blade Warband, TESIV: Oblivion, Democracy 4, Albion Online, and Hearts of Iron IV. Yes, I play on Linux.<br>
         I like computers and technology, I will write about both in other posts.<br>
         My favorite programming language is Rust, but I am still learning.<br>
         Most people I know have fewer siblings than I do.</p>
      <p>Thank you for reading to the end, I am trying to work on this site daily, you can check weekly for new updates if you are interested.</p>
