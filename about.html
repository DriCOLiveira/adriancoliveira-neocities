      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, my name is Adrian, and I'm an Electronics Technician with a passion for technology and innovation. Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development, where I'm exploring new ways to apply my skills and knowledge.</p>
      <p>Throughout my studies, I've worked on some exciting projects, including designing and building my own power supply and using Arduino to generate an image and display it on a monitor for a math-based game, also running on the same Arduino board. Being interested in games and anime, I've sometimes explored game development and drawing skills. Although I'm still a beginner in these areas, it would be cool to learn more and improve my abilities.</p>
      <p>As someone who's always been fascinated by technology, I'm excited to put my skills into practice in new projects. Whether it's developing innovative software solutions or contributing to the open-source community, I'm grateful for the opportunities I've had so far, and I look forward to the many more that lie ahead.</p>
