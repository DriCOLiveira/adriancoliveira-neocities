### Description
Hello, I am Adrian and that's my first public web page. I think you could say it's a blog. Everything is written in plain html, css, and js because I want to gather more experience in these before using a framework.

### Status
There's still a lot to be done. The page has only one post, most links don't work, and the navbar is broken on low-resolution screens.

### Misc
I left that project here for you to take a look. I am pretty sure you will find rookie mistakes in the code.
